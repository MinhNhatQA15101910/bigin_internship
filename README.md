# **Project Description: Product Management System**

## **Overview**

The **Product Management System** is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of products, users, orders, and carts. This system allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and place orders while providing administrators with tools to manage inventory and track sales efficiently.

## **Key Features**

- **User Management**: Supports user authentication, profile management, and role-based access (e.g., customers, admins).
- **Product Management**: Enables admins to add, update, and remove products, along with setting prices, descriptions, and stock availability.
- **Cart System**: Allows users to add products to their cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Processing**: Handles order placement, tracking, and status updates (e.g., pending, shipped, completed).
- **Dashboard & Analytics**: Provides insights into sales trends, popular products, and user activity.

## **Entities**

1. **User**: Represents customers and admins with attributes such as name, email, password, and role.
2. **Product**: Stores product details like name, price, description, category, stock, and images.
3. **Cart**: A temporary collection of products a user intends to purchase.
4. **Order**: Captures transaction details, including products purchased, total amount, and order status.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: Vue.js (for user interface)
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (for business logic)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / SQLite / MongoDB (for storing data)
- **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth (for secure user login)

## **Goals**

- Create a user-friendly interface for seamless product browsing and purchasing.
- Develop a robust backend to handle product management and order processing efficiently.
- Ensure data security and smooth transactions.
